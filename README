README for portz
=========================

portz is a simple ports system aimed to work on mingw+msys 
environment.

It's dirty hack allowing to automagically install developer 
soft on windows machines just like FreeBSD ports do or apt 
on Debian.

It's aimed for developers.

If environment variable PORTZ_SEPARATE_EXEC is equal to 1 then
portz will automagically differentiate exec prefix for installed packages. It will be:
    ${prefix}/platforms/$(uname -m)
which will result in:
    ${prefix}/platforms/{i686|x86_64|sun4u} 
or something.
