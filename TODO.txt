Feature Requests / Wishes List
===============================

Accepted
--------

List of ideas clear and accepted for implementation:

* (4) version override ./portz_install pcre version=8.29
  Will be done using autoconf like overrides, so def will be changed from:
  
    version=1.2
    baseurl=http://foo/bar/baz-${version}.tar.gz
    
  to
    version=1.2
    baseurl=http://foo/bar/baz-@version@.tar.gz
    
  Replacement will be done after merging package & "override" params using sed.
  
* (1) --help for all commands
 partially implemented, as portz is now interface

* (7) subtasks dependency tracking;
  'portz invoke next' shall be added, and portz shall know which
  steps have been completed in package "build/staging" area
 
* (9) manual 

Grooming / ideas
---------------

* easy installable install script
  not sure how yet ...
    
* (6) renaming of steps, so they are easy "spellable" in invoke
  Currently fetch_src, patch, configure, ... build is not documented
  
* (2) cleanup of /tmp folder

* (3) functional tests !

Implemented
----------------

Ideas already implemented:

* (3) installation of package version, so we know what is installed
 -> now in PKGINFO
 
* (5) make patch utility
  portz make_patch on already
  
* (6) package dependencies
  depends="foo"
  
* (8) uniform CLI frontend, 'portz'
  'portz' frontend created
